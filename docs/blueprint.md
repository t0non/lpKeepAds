## Style Guidelines:

- The palette is dark and modern, evoking professionalism and innovation. The primary color is a vibrant electric blue (#00AAFF) for high-impact elements and calls to action. The background features a very dark, desaturated blue-gray (#192328), providing a sleek, sophisticated canvas. A complementary, vivid violet (#8A4DF0) is used sparingly for accents and highlights, enhancing visual interest and focus.
- Body and headline font: 'Poppins' (geometric sans-serif) for a modern, precise, and highly legible aesthetic across all content. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Minimalist and modern icons, specifically chosen from Lucide Icons, will be used to reinforce messages without distracting from the content, aligning with the clean, professional visual theme.
- The layout emphasizes clear content hierarchy with generous padding and margins between sections, promoting readability and user flow. Sections feature full-width designs with centrally aligned content, ensuring visual stability and professionalism. Key conversion areas are strategically positioned and highlighted to draw attention to call-to-actions, which will be notably large and legible.
- Elements will smoothly animate into view with a subtle fade-up effect as the user scrolls, creating a dynamic and engaging experience. Service cards will exhibit a gentle scale (1.05) and shadow shift on hover, while call-to-action buttons will feature an enticing glow or pulsing effect to amplify their prominence and encourage interaction.
